## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
    - The Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
    - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### What I learned

- Using Sass made things easier in the responsiveness and styling. It also allowed me to deconstruct the styling into different layers. I still need to be better structure and refactore it to make it DRY. 

- A bit of challenge was to move from mobile to tablet especially that the body structure was mobile-oriented at first but I managed to deal with it.

- The email validity code I already used for previous project. Refactored to match some aspects of modern JS syntax (I am really proud of it that I reuse whenever possibleðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‹)

```js
let email = document.querySelector("#email");
const errorMsg = document.querySelector("#error");
const form = document.querySelector("form");

let emailValidity = email.validity;

let emailValidation = (input, validator) => {
    if(input.value === ""){
        errorMsg.innerHTML = "Oops! Please add your email";
        errorMsg.classList.add("display-error");
    }
    else if(!validator.valid){
        errorMsg.innerHTML = "Oops! Please check your email";
        errorMsg.classList.add("display-error");
    }
    else {
        errorMsg.classList.remove("display-error");
    }
}

form.addEventListener("submit", e =>{
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(e.target.value);
    emailValidation(email, emailValidity);
})

```
